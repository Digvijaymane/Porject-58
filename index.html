        <p> Eventually, I solved the puzzle in 2 Minute. In those days It used to appear in every Saturday newspaper and I used to solve it with great enthusiasm to see my interest developing my father bought me a 3 by 3 cube puzzle book with 5 of puzzles that my Brother and I used to solve every evening This game forced us to use our brain more and more and unlike other puzzles, a person never gets bored of playing this game. In fact, even today I play 3 by 3 cube puzzle regularly. </p>
